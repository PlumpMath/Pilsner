Pilsner
-------

A lisp inspired primarily by Clojure and Scheme. Implemented in C with no dependencies so far. My goal is to be able to use this for interactive play things and little games, etc. Compared to Clojure, I want a better debugging experience. Compared to Scheme, I want some more of the nice things Clojure has (most of which is not currently implemented, obviously...)
